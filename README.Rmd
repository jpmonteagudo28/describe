The goal of describe is to make it easy to compute descriptive statistics for non-normal distributions without creating custom functions or spending hours researching stack overflow. This package also provides flexible and intuitive univariate and multiple data imputation and visualizations for exploratory data analysis. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of describe like so:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jpmonteagudo28/describe")
```
You can also install it from CRAN like so:

```r
install.packages("describe")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(describe)

# Generate random data with NAs
data <- gen.mcar(50,rho = .467,sigma = c(1,1.3),n_vars = 2, na_prob = .10)

# Impute missing values using predictive mean matching
imputed_data <- pmean.match(data, robust = TRUE, verbose = TRUE)

head(imputed_data,10)

summary(imputed_data)

```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r}
# Some examples of bootstrapped correlation coefficients and geometric median
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
# Plot something here
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
