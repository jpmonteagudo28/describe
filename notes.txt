Checklist for describe package:

Goal: To provide estimates of central tendency for different distributions and simple imputation methods for handling missing data.

1. Add imputation methods to keep rectangular data (matrix/df)

2. Add imputation method argument to each function. If imputation not chosen, treat rectangular data as dimensionless object

3. Update description files

4. Update markdown help for each function except Internals

5. Add logo

6. Create pkgdown site with url: describe.jpmonteagudo.com

7. Add R CMD check and pkgdown workflows

8. Create utils.R file for helpers


IMPUTATION CHECKLIST

1. regression models defined for normal and non-normal data and classification models (lm,rlm,glm)

	a. MASS package: rlm - robust
	b.

2. Check if predictive mean matching can be used for singular imputation

3. Check if predictive mean matching needs additional checks and how it's creating its regression models

4. Add data augmentation method to check.mar function when perfect separation happens. As a result, glm fit algorithm did not converge.(fimd, 3.6)
